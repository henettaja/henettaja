### Welcome! ‚ú®

I'm a software developer at [Tietoevry](www.tietoevry.com) and an alum from [Haaga-Helia University Of Applied Sciences](https://www.haaga-helia.fi/en). I love to help top-notch user experiences become a reality by the means of code and communication.

üßëüèº‚Äçüíª Currently working on a customer project and getting to know Next.js 13

#### What motivates me

Contributing to ambitious products and services with great UX that also keep digital accessibility in mind ü´∂

Angular deserves a shout out for showing me how beatiful the combo of declarative and reactive programming paradigms can be.
